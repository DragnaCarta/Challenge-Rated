<h2 align="center"> Why (& How) Challenge Rated Works</h2>

Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition is a tabletop role-playing game with three
central modes of gameplay: exploration, social interaction, and combat. While
exploration and social interaction are critical parts of gameplay, “there is
no doubt about it that the game was designed with swords and sorcery in mind.”
Combat is “an essential part of the game.”

However, while some Dungeon Masters have sought to faithfully apply the game’s combat-building principles, many others have found those mechanics wanting. One author writes, “One of the most common mistakes among new dungeon masters is solely relying on challenge rating”—5th Edition’s system for evaluating the difficulty of a combat encounter—“for balancing a combat encounter. While a monster's CR provides a rough estimation of what to expect in terms of balance, it's not enough information for every context.”

Over time, some in the 5th Edition community have come to regard the official combat-building system as a lost cause. One commenter writes, “A lot of it is experience and guesswork—start out underestimating your party, and then balance up as you find out their strengths and weaknesses.” Another advises, “If you want danger you're going to have to ignore CR and throw whatever you want at your [p]layers.” A third suggests, “The CR [system] is hopelessly broken below [CR] 1 and above [CRs] 7 or 8.” A fourth concludes, “Battle balancing in 5e is an art based on pseudoscience.”

Many Dungeon Masters have come to agree that the “action economy”—the total number of actions that each side in a combat encounter can take per round—is the key to understanding combat balance. “Action Economy is the most important thing, followed by terrain,” writes one. It’s “a reason [why] challenge rating[s] [are] not considered accurate,” writes another.
